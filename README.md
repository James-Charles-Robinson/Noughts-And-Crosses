# What I Learnt
While coding this game i learnt how to use the libary pygame. This was a large challenge to me as this was my first attempt at a large application. Before this, i was used to making 200 line projects and less. You can see that I struggled with keeping the code efficient. However I did my best to include as many functions as possible. In total i used 17, quite a good learning experience for me. I know i could improve this project, however i have decided to move on a make better things. In the future i would like to use classes.
