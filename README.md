A pygame application complete with an easy, normal and hard AI along with a 2 player mode. Complete with multiple menus and a score tracking system.
# What I Learnt
While coding this game i learnt how to use the libary pygame. This was a large challenge to me as this was my first attempt at a large application. Before this moment i was used to makeing 200 line projects and less. You can see that I struggled with keeping the code effient. However I did my best to include as many functions as possible. In total i used 17, quite a good learning experience for me.
